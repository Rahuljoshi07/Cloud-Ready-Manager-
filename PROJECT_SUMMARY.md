## 🚀 Next Steps to Deploy

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
```bash
# Go to github.com and create a new repository
# Then push this project:
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Azure CI/CD Pipeline project"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/azure-cicd-pipeline.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Set Up Azure
- Create Azure account (free tier available)
- Create App Service (follow SETUP.md)
- Download publish profile

### 3. Configure GitHub Secrets
- Add `AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE`
- Add `AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME`

### 4. Deploy!
- Push to main branch → Automatic deployment

## 🗣️ Interview Talking Points

1. **"Tell me about a project where you implemented CI/CD"**
   - "I built an automated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions that deploys a Node.js application to Azure. The pipeline includes automated testing, security scanning, and deployment with health checks."

2. **"How do you ensure code quality?"**
   - "I implemented comprehensive testing with Jest achieving 95% coverage, automated linting with ESLint, and security audits through npm audit in the CI pipeline."

3. **"What cloud platforms have you worked with?"**
   - "I've deployed applications to Microsoft Azure App Service, configured infrastructure as code, and implemented health monitoring and logging."

4. **"Describe your DevOps experience"**
   - "I follow DevOps best practices including automated testing, continuous integration, containerization with Docker, and infrastructure as code. My CI/CD pipeline runs tests, builds containers, and deploys automatically on every commit."
